- `openai/gpt-4o` - OpenAI GPT-4o
- `google/gemini-pro-1.5` - Google Gemini Pro 1.5
- `meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct` - Meta Llama 3.1 70B
- And many more at [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models)

**Alternative: Direct OpenAI:**
```env
LLM_PROVIDER_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
LLM_PROVIDER_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o
```

**Alternative: Blackbox AI:**
```env
LLM_PROVIDER_BASE_URL=https://api.blackbox.ai/api/chat
LLM_PROVIDER_API_KEY=your-blackbox-api-key
LLM_MODEL=blackboxai/openai/gpt-4o
```

The system automatically prefers OpenRouter configuration if available, falling back to legacy LLM configuration if not.

## Architecture Notes

- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM. All data (operators, nodes, users, profiles, AI conversations, agent tasks, usage records, workflow sessions, scheduled workflows, OSINT tasks, beacons, credentials, attack paths) lives in PostgreSQL tables.
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter-powered LLM integration supporting multiple AI models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.) for AI chat, workflow orchestration, and autonomous operations.
- **Realtime**: Supabase Realtime (optional) provides instant dashboard updates for node status via `postgres_changes` on the `nodes` table. Falls back to 5-second REST polling when Supabase env vars are not configured.
- **Auth**: Operator accounts in PostgreSQL, JWT tokens via `jose`, session cookies.
- **Workflow System**: AI-powered orchestration engine with intent analysis, function registry, and response generation. Supports session persistence, template-based workflows, progress tracking, and scheduled execution.
- **OSINT Module**: Domain enumeration and intelligence gathering with certificate transparency integration, DNS enumeration, WHOIS lookups, and optional DNS brute force. Includes rate limiting, caching, and proxy routing for operational security.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Multi-source IOC analysis with VirusTotal, Abuse.ch feeds, and AlienVault OTX integration. Features detection percentages, reputation scoring, and comprehensive threat analysis.
- **Implant Compilation**: Advanced compilation service with enhanced binary packing using UPX, custom scripts, intelligent caching, and comprehensive statistics. Supports multiple compression algorithms and platform-specific optimizations.
- **Post-Exploitation Framework**: Comprehensive offensive security toolkit with autonomous agents, Bloodhound integration, credential vault, and attack technique implementations. Features OPSEC scoring, attack path analysis, and swarm integration.
- **Beacons Management**: Full-featured implant management system with real-time status tracking, filtering, detailed information display, and integration with post-exploitation capabilities.
- **Bloodhound Integration**: Complete graph analysis support with data import/export, relationship mapping, and attack path visualization for Active Directory environments.
- **Attack Techniques**: Implementation of common offensive security techniques including AS-REP roasting, DCOM, Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash, SMB, WinRM, and WMI for post-exploitation activities.
- **Notification System**: Comprehensive notification system with email support, unread count tracking, and real-time alerts for operational events.
- **Infrastructure**: Rate limiting with Redis/memory backend, in-memory caching with TTL, and Hysteria2 proxy routing for all external HTTP requests.
- All outbound HTTP from the panel (LLM API calls, web fetches from agents, OSINT/threat intel API calls) is routed through the Hysteria 2 node's SOCKS5/HTTP port using `undici.ProxyAgent`.
- The panel acts as an HTTP Auth backend for Hysteria 2 (`/api/hysteria/auth`) — Hysteria calls it to validate client tokens against the panel's local user store.
- Subscription format is base64-encoded newline-separated `hysteria2://` URIs, compatible with standard clients.

## ShadowGrok Autonomous C2 Operations

ShadowGrok is an autonomous C2 operations system powered by xAI's Grok API, enabling natural language control of complex red team operations.

### Capabilities

- **12 Specialized C2 Tools**: Implant generation, deployment, task execution, traffic analysis, and operations orchestration
- **Natural Language Operations**: Describe operations in plain language, ShadowGrok plans and executes them autonomously
- **Safety Guardrails**: Built-in approval workflows for high-risk operations, OPSEC risk assessment, and comprehensive audit logging
- **Real-time Execution**: Streaming tool execution with live progress updates and detailed logging

### Available Tools

- `generate_stealth_implant_config` - Generate stealthy implant configurations with anti-analysis features
- `compile_and_deploy_implant` - Compile and deploy implants to target nodes
- `send_c2_task_to_implant` - Execute commands on live implants (recon, exfiltration, persistence)
- `query_implant_status` - Query real-time implant status and health
- `trigger_kill_switch` - Execute kill switches with proper confirmation
- `analyze_traffic_and_suggest_evasion` - Analyze traffic patterns and recommend evasion techniques
- `orchestrate_full_operation` - Plan multi-phase operations with automatic tool chaining
- `run_panel_command` - Execute panel commands (with approval)
- `update_node_config` - Dynamically update Hysteria2 node configurations
- `query_hysteria_traffic_stats` - Fetch live traffic statistics
- `list_active_implants` - List and query active implants
- `assess_opsec_risk` - Assess operational security risk before actions

### Safety Features

- **Approval Workflows**: High-risk operations require explicit admin approval
- **OPSEC Assessment**: Automatic risk scoring before sensitive operations
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all tool executions and approvals
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable limits on tool execution rounds and concurrent operations
- **Timeout Protection**: Automatic timeout for long-running operations

### Configuration

Enable ShadowGrok by setting `SHADOWGROK_ENABLED=true` and providing your xAI API key:

```bash
SHADOWGROK_ENABLED=true
XAI_API_KEY=your-xai-api-key
XAI_MODEL=grok-4.20-reasoning
SHADOWGROK_REQUIRE_APPROVAL=true
```

### Usage Example

```
User: "Deploy a maximum stealth implant to Node-07 with Spotify traffic blending, run recon, then establish persistence and report back."

ShadowGrok autonomously:
1. Calls generate_stealth_implant_config with Windows, maximum stealth, Spotify profile
2. Calls compile_and_deploy_implant to build and deploy the implant
3. Calls send_c2_task_to_implant with recon tasks
4. Calls query_implant_status to verify deployment
5. Provides comprehensive operation report
```

### Security Considerations

- ShadowGrok is disabled by default. Enable only after reviewing safety configurations.
- All operations are logged to `shadowgrok_executions` and `shadowgrok_tool_calls` tables.
- High-risk tools (kill switches, panel commands) require approval even when auto-approve is enabled.
- Review the `shadowgrok_approvals` table regularly for pending approvals.
- Keep xAI API keys secure and rotate them regularly.

## Post-Exploitation Framework

The post-exploitation framework provides comprehensive offensive security capabilities with autonomous agents, Bloodhound integration, and attack technique implementations.

### Core Components

- **Post-Exploitation Engine**: Central orchestration system that manages agent execution, coordinates between different components, and handles task distribution.
- **Autonomous Agents**: Specialized agents for different post-exploitation activities:
  - **AD Reconnaissance Agent**: Active Directory reconnaissance and enumeration
  - **Credential Harvester Agent**: Automated credential collection and extraction
  - **Lateral Movement Agent**: Horizontal movement and network traversal
  - **Privilege Escalation Agent**: Escalation of privileges within compromised environments
- **Bloodhound Integration**: Complete graph analysis for Active Directory environments:
  - Import Bloodhound JSON data for analysis
  - Export data in Bloodhound-compatible formats
  - Analyze attack paths and relationships
  - Store graph data for persistent analysis
- **Credential Vault**: Secure storage for collected credentials with encryption and access controls.
- **OPSEC Scorer**: Operational security assessment tool that evaluates the risk level of planned operations.
- **Pathfinder**: Attack path analysis tool that identifies optimal routes for lateral movement and privilege escalation.

### Attack Techniques

The framework includes implementations of common offensive security techniques:

- **AS-REP Roasting**: Kerberos attack technique targeting accounts without pre-authentication
- **DCOM**: Distributed Component Object Model for remote execution
- **Kerberoasting**: Kerberos service ticket cracking for service account credentials
- **Pass-the-Hash**: Authentication using NTLM hashes instead of plaintext passwords
- **SMB**: Server Message Block for file transfer and remote execution
- **WinRM**: Windows Remote Management for system administration
- **WMI**: Windows Management Instrumentation for system management and monitoring

### Swarm Integration

The post-exploitation framework integrates with the multi-agent swarm architecture for coordinated operations:

- Agent coordination and task distribution
- Shared intelligence and credential vault access
- Synchronized execution across multiple compromised systems
- Centralized logging and audit trail

### Configuration

The post-exploitation framework uses the existing database schema and integrates with the notification system for operational updates.

## Beacons Management

## Supabase Realtime Setup (Optional)

If you want real-time node status updates on the dashboard (beyond the 5s polling fallback):

1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. Run the SQL in `prisma/supabase-realtime.sql` to enable Realtime + RLS on the `nodes` table

## Deployment

- Deploy to Vercel / Cloud Run / any Node 20 host.
- The panel does **not** manage a Hysteria 2 binary for production use. Run Hysteria 2 via systemd and point the panel at its Traffic Stats API (`HYSTERIA_TRAFFIC_API_BASE_URL`).
